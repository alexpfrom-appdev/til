Quick tips on git

Git status          --  this shows you what you have committed 
Git branch -v    -- show all the branches you have
Git checkout main  -- this would take you back to main branch
Git checkout hello-world  -- these takes you to a specific branch (branches can only be one word)
Git checkout -b “name of new branch”   -- this is to create a new branch. You don’t need the quotes
Git add .   -   adds everything you just saved from all files
Git add ruby/acronym/acronym_test.rb  -- commits only the specific rb file
Git stash    -- takes you back to level before all of your commits
Git stash pop    -- if you decide you don’t want to “git stash” this moves you forward to the changes you made
